## Setup 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/willuhm-js/carview 
cd carview/src 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
python main.py 
```

### Setup Issues
Sometimes one of the packages (`requests` or `bs4`) might cause issues when attempting to install. If so, just install both manually one at a time. If the problem continues, try `python3.8 main.py`, instead of `python main.py`.


### Future
Add CLO
Add install.py
